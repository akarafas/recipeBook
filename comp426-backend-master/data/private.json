    "Homemade Gyros": {
      "title": "Homemade Gyros",
      "ing": "For the Meat Mixture: 1 pound ground lamb (or beef), 1/4 cup red onion (minced), 2 cloves garlic (minced), 2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, \nFor the Sandwich: 4 rounds flatbread (or pita),1 leaf of lettuce,1 tomato (sliced), 1 onion (sliced), Tzatziki sauce",
      "inst": "To Make the Meat Mixture: \n1.) The first step in making any gyro is to prepare the meat. It is very easy and should take just a few minutes, though you will need to let it marinade for an hour, so plan ahead.\n2.) Gather the ingredients.\n3.) Thoroughly combine all the ingredients in a bowl.\n4.) Divide into four equal portions and shape into oblong patties about 3-inch wide by 6-inch long by 1/2-inch thick. Notice that the patty is shaped more like a sausage - long and thin - rather than a hamburger patty. This is intentional, to ensure the patty fits in the flatbread.\n5.) Refrigerate for one hour.\n\nTo Build the Sandwich\n1.) You can grill the patties on your outdoor grill or fry them up in a pan on the stove. The goal is to have crisp edges on the patty.\n2.) Also, the toppings that go into a traditional gyro are simple: tzatziki, lettuce, tomato, and onion. If you prefer, you can skip the onion because there are already onions in the meat.\n3.) Grill the patties over high heat for 3 to 4 minutes per side.\n4.) Spread tzatziki sauce down the center of a flatbread round or in the pocket of the pita.\n5.) Add a lettuce leaf, some diced tomato, and a few thin onion slices.\n6.) Add the patty and fold the bread over the lamb, if using a flatbread. If using a pita, put the patty inside the pita pocket.\n7.) Enjoy!"

    "Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies": {
      "title": "Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies",
      "ing": "2 and 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled), 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks or 170g) unsalted butter, melted & slightly cooled, 3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar, 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature, 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 1 and 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks",
      "inst": "1.)\tWhisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.\n2.)\tIn a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg, then the egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, yet thick. Fold in the chocolate chunks. They may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them. Cover the dough and chill in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours or up to 3-4 days. Chilling is mandatory. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.\n3.)\tTake the dough out of the refrigerator and allow to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.\n4.)\tPreheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside.\n5.)\tRoll the dough into balls, about 3 Tablespoons of dough each. The dough will be crumbly, but the warmth of your hands will help the balls stay together. Roll the cookie dough balls to be taller rather than wide, to ensure the cookies will bake up to be thick. See this post for more detail and a photo. Place 8 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. Press a few more chocolate chips/chunks on top of the dough balls for looks, if desired.\n6.)\tBake the cookies for 12-13 minutes. The cookies will look very soft and underbaked. They will continue to bake on the cookie sheet. Allow to cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\n7.)\tCookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.\n"
